# Standing Non-Linear Waves

[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

This repository contains simulation code for studying the dynamics of standing non-linear waves using the Basilisk flow solver. The code implements both analytical Stokes wave solutions and experimental best-fit initial conditions to investigate wave dynamics with adaptive mesh refinement.

## Overview

The project focuses on simulating standing waves using a two-phase flow solver with surface tension. It explores:
- Non-linear wave dynamics using Stokes wave theory
- Adaptive mesh refinement for accurate interface tracking
- Comparison between analytical and experimental initial conditions

## Installation and Setup

To ensure you have the necessary tools and a fresh Basilisk installation, use the provided script:

```bash
./reset_install_requirements.sh
```

### Function
This script checks for Basilisk installation and compiles it if not present.

### OS Compatibility
Designed for macOS and Linux systems.

### Dependencies
- Basilisk C (automatically installed)
- C compiler (gcc/clang)
- Make build system

### Environment Setup
After running the script, a `.project_config` file is created, setting `BASILISK` and `PATH` automatically.

For a fresh installation:
```bash
./reset_install_requirements.sh --hard
```

## Running the Code

### Using Makefile (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the test cases directory:
```bash
cd testCases
```

2. Compile and run:
```bash
make StokesStandingWaves
```

### Direct Compilation

```bash
qcc -O2 -Wall -disable-dimensions StokesStandingWaves.c -o StokesStandingWaves -lm
```

### Execution

The program accepts the following parameters:
```bash
./StokesStandingWaves maxLevel We Ohd tf Ohs De Ec tmax
```

where:
- `maxLevel`: Maximum refinement level for adaptive mesh
- `We`: Weber number
- `Ohd`: Ohnesorge number for the drop
- `tf`: Shell thickness
- `Ohs`: Shell Ohnesorge number
- `De`: Deborah number
- `Ec`: Elasto-capillary number
- `tmax`: Maximum simulation time

## Features

- Two-phase flow simulation with surface tension
- Adaptive mesh refinement for interface tracking
